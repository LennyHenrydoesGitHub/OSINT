How to use:

- I grouped data sets from SPIRI in folders 
- I cleaned(ish) data and created .csv versions of data sets
- Scripts manipulate csv versions of datasets
- Work in progress
- Most work is in Military_spending_all_world and Trade Registry
- some scripts show results in terminal some generate plots

To run a script:

1. Navigate to folder in directory from terminal
2. Type python script_name.py and hit enter 
- you need to uncomment relevant lines under "Usage" comments inside code

Hope this helps
Work in progress
