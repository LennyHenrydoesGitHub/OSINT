## Data Processing
  - Creates arrays and stuff to be used in the RNN 

## Model 1
  - Basic model
  - Uses a set amount of 1s and 0s
  - Can change the structure of the RNN easily
  - Un-optimised things such as optimiser, structure, learning rate, etc.

## Model 2
  - GPU capability added
  - More complex model
    -  uses a bidirectional LSTM
    -  Dropout added
    -  Increased hidden layer size
